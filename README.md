# virus-research-python
This repository is for the research that I (Xavier Silva) am doing from Summer 2023 - present.

## The Research
The research involves finding transitions between states of icosahedral viruses that preserve various types of icosahedral symmetry.
Finding these transitions involves solving matrix equations of the form `TB_0 = B_1` for `T`.
`T` is a general form of a 6x6 matrix which depends on which symmetry we are searching for.

## How To Use The Program
This repository consists of one main python script to run and two helper python scripts.
The main script is `combineorderedtuples.py`.

The two helper scripts are `permutetestcases.py` and `picklestocsv.py`.

Running any of them with the `-h` or `--help` flag with give more information on how to use them.
